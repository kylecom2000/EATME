# EATME
### A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
## [Deployed on Heroku](https://boiling-falls-40354.herokuapp.com/)

### Overview
* A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 
* Following the MVC design pattern; 
* Node and MySQL queries and route data
* Handlebars to generate your HTML.


### Work Flow
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the page waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
